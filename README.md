**🐾 Animal Image Classifier - ResNet34**<br><br>
**📌 Project Overview**<br>
This project is a deep learning-based "animal image classifier" trained using the **Animals-90 dataset**. <br>
The model utilizes "Transfer Learning" with a "ResNet34" backbone to accurately classify images into one of "90 different animal categories". <br>
<br>
